					<p ng-if="isCrazy" class="bio_text">Albert is a funky llama. He pushes the bounderies of fashion and turns heads. The other llama's love to see what Albert comes up with next. He enjoys thrifting and making his own accessories. He is a world-traveler and enjoys diving into new adventures. We can't wait to see where Felix finds inspiration next.</p>
					<p ng-if="isSoph" class="bio_text">Felix is a sophisticated llama. He divides his time between his penthouse in New York and the Hamptons. He enjoys his job as an interior designer where he can let his true creativity thrive. Felix is always dressed to impress, and he succeeds. Diane Von Furstenberg once complemented him on his suit - he has yet to take it off. </p>
					<p ng-if="isAth" class="bio_text">Blaze is an athletic llama. When you ask him to jump, he asks "how high?" He once beat Usain Bolt in the 200m. Nike recently tried to sponsor him, but they are still working out the details of the shoe contract since that's a little tricky for Blaze. Unfortunately, Blaze chose to not compete in Rio last summer due to the Zika virus and also the no llama rule.</p>
					<p ng-if="isHip" class="bio_text">Summer is a flower child llama. Her free spirit has led her in travels all over the world. She learned how to speak Italian in Rome, how to surf in Cape Town, and the meaning of life in Bali. Recently, she found a wonderful field to graze in that happened to also be hosting Bonnaroo. Needless to say, she is a happy llama.</p>
					<p ng-if="isFun" class="bio_text">Becky is a pretty llama. She knows the latest fashions and tbh she sets them. She loves shopping and having a cosmo after work with the girls. The girl llama's want to be her and the boy llama's want to be with her. She is a llama girl in a llama world and loving it.</p>
					<p ng-if="isWork" class="bio_text">Bridget is a wallstreet-balling llama. She looks great in a blazer as she strolls into the office with her latte. No matter the weather, Bridget knows how to keep her outfit classy and stylish. Not to worry, she also enjoys using her vacation days to escape to her fab vacation home in the Alps where she can lounge with her llama friends.</p>

					<p class="bio_text develop_text">I modeled my site off of Buzzfeed quizzes, but gave it a twist. The pictures within the quiz are all merchandise available at Zappos.com. As someone who shops on the Zappos website a lot, I had a lot of fun putting together the page. I love the front-end web development means that I can make fun, interesting and useful applications. I purposefully made the design of the site simple and mobile-responsive. The llama a user gets is determined by their fashion choices, all of which are kept track of in a service in the JavaScript.
